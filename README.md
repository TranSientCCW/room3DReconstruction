# Reconstruction of office from a set of 3D point clouds

#### Goal:  
Reconstruct an office room from a set of 3D point clouds acquired from an Intel RealSense depth sensor that was moved to scan different views

#### Data: 
The data comes from a set of 3D point clouds acquired by an Intel RealSense depth sensor.
It  consists of N=40 frames of 3D point cloud data, where each frame is from a different viewpoint. 
The data is stored in a cell structure with N cells, each with 2 entries: X.Color which is the RGB value of each point and X.Location, which is the XYZ location of each point (and X is the cell
Index. 
The original RGB or XYZ images are 480 rows by 640 columns by 3 channels but are encoded as a list of points(480*640,3).
